      <span class="css-93" style="text-align: left;">In the absence of required standards for publicly reporting energy use data, individual companies report their energy use using a wide range of units and methodologies. To capture as much data as possible for each company, our data processing team sometimes needs to use indirect calculations or estimation to find energy values. When one or more of these methods are used, data values reported on the “Company Analysis” page are accompanied by a methodological note which allows dashboard viewers to trace the listed value back to the original report. Below are our current categories of methods.</span>
