# Visualization Data Center Energy Use & Emissions from 20 of the Largest Global Technology Companies

## In this project, we develop a Shiny application which allows the user to interactively engage with our dataset collected by the Industrial Sustainability Analysis Lab and University of California, Santa Barbara. Specifically this app explores:

### 1. How energy use and emissions change over time for individual companies (2010 - 2020)

### 2. How energy use and emissions change between companies over time (2010 - 2020)

### 3. How aggregate energy use and emission from all companies and data centers is changing over time (2010 - 2020)
